### INSAT IIA4

**Technologies:** Java, AnyLogic, anyLogistix, Supply Chain Optimization, Digital Twin Development, Performance Modeling, 3D Simulation

## Introduction

This project delved into the creation of a digital twin framework for optimizing biscuit production and supply chain management. Leveraging AnyLogic and anyLogistix simulators, the project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for a production line, optimizing material handling processes, streamlining order cycles, and modeling supply chain dynamics for biscuit production.

## Project Scope

Conducted from February 8, 2023, to May 4, 2023, during the 4th year of Industrial Computing and Automation at INSAT, this project served as a semester-long endeavor to validate the principles of the "Modeling and Evaluation Performance" subject.

## Technical Details

- **Production Line Modeling**: Engineered a production line utilizing AnyLogic with 3 key workstations for dough preparation, baking, and topping operations, ensuring consistent product quality.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Implemented a streamlined production workflow incorporating reception, rerouting, production, storage, and distribution of finished products, accounting for real-world time delays and scenarios.
- **Material Handling Optimization**: Enhanced material handling processes through the deployment of conveyors and carts, reducing transfer times by 20%.
- **Order Cycle Optimization**: Optimized the complete order cycle, achieving rapid order processing times and timely order fulfillment with an average order processing time of 11 minutes.
- **Supply Chain Modeling**: Modeled supply management scenarios using anyLogistix, fine-tuning parameters to accurately reflect system dynamics and optimize stock management.
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Procurement**: Implemented a JIT procurement system to reduce storage and raw material management costs by 28% while ensuring continuous availability for production.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Optimized stock levels and pricing strategies to ensure positive revenue generation and minimize average daily inventory levels.
- **End-to-End Procurement Simulation**: Simulated an end-to-end procurement process, optimizing inventory organization and coordinating efficient delivery logistics.
- **Digital Twin Framework Development**: Developed a digital twin framework integrating models of goods transformation and supply management subsystems, enabling real-time monitoring of system behavior.
